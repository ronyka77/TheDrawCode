# Feature Selection Process Improvement Plan

## Problem Analysis

- **Issue**: Current feature selection process needs optimization for better model performance
- **Current State**: 
  - Fixed weights for composite scoring (Gain 50%, Weight 30%, Cover 20%)
  - Basic feature selection without redundancy analysis
  - Limited stability validation
- **Affected Components**:
  - Feature selection pipeline
  - Model training workflow
  - Performance evaluation metrics
- **Performance Considerations**:
