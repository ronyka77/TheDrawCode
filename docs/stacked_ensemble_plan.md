# Stacked Ensemble Project Plan

## Current Status

### Project Overview
- Version: 2.0.0
- Status: Implementation Phase
- Last Updated: 2024-03-21

### Project Objectives
- Develop a robust binary classification system using stacked ensemble methods
- Optimize model performance through distributed hyperparameter tuning
- Maintain CPU-only execution constraints
- Achieve high precision while maintaining minimum 20% recall threshold
- Ensure model diversity and prediction robustness
- Implement advanced stacking and validation strategies

### Data Flow Strategy
1. **Training Data (`X_train`)**
   - Primary use: Model training and nested cross-validation
   - Role: Core training data for all base models
   - Never used for final evaluation or threshold optimization

2. **Test Data (`X_test`)**
   - Primary use: Early stopping during model training
   - Role: Prevents overfitting during training phase
   - Not used for final performance evaluation

3. **Validation Data (`X_val`)**
   - Primary use: Multiple validation purposes
   - Roles:
     - Final model evaluation
     - Threshold optimization (with 20% recall constraint)
     - Meta-feature generation for stacking
     - Meta-learner training
   - Completely held-out set to ensure unbiased evaluation
