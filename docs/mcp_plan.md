# Model Context Protocol Server (MCPS) Plan

## 1. Project Overview & Goals

**Objective:**
- Build a Model Context Protocol Server (MCPS) that acts as the central hub for managing the entire lifecycle of soccer prediction models, including training, tuning, evaluation, and context-aware metadata management.
- Ensure strict adherence to Soccer Prediction Project guidelines:
  - Enforce CPU-only training (XGBoost with `tree_method='hist'`, CatBoost with `device='cpu'`)
  - Implement robust logging via ExperimentLogger (structured JSON, ISO 8601 timestamps, file rotations)
  - Integrate MLflow tracking for full experiment reproducibility
  - Maintain strict versioning and reproducibility protocols
- Expose a robust API (RESTful/gRPC) for external clients to:
  - Trigger/schedule training runs and hyperparameter tuning
  - Monitor real-time training progress and access historical data
  - Retrieve contextual metadata and model performance metrics

**Key Outcomes:**
- Centralized server managing training contexts for XGBoost/CatBoost models
- Comprehensive API endpoints for:
  - Task initiation/control (start, stop, resume)
  - Real-time status monitoring and log access
  - Contextual metadata retrieval (hyperparameters, metrics, sample counts)
- Protocol-compliant documentation with traceability to [docs/plan.md](../docs/plan.md) and [DOCS-CHANGELOG.md](../DOCS-CHANGELOG.md)

## 2. Requirement Analysis & Codebase Assessment

### A. Functional Requirements
- **Model Training & Tuning:**
  - Support launch/monitoring of XGBoost & CatBoost training with Optuna hyperparameter tuning
- **MLflow Integration:**
  - Log parameters, metrics, signatures, and artifacts for every run
- **API Controls:**
  - RESTful/gRPC endpoints for training operations, status monitoring, and historical data access

### B. Non-Functional Requirements
- **CPU-Only Enforcement:** Configurations must prevent GPU usage
- **Structured Logging:** ExperimentLogger with JSON format and file rotation
- **Surgical Changes:** Minimal code modifications following project guidelines

### C. Technical Review
- **Existing Assets:**
  - CatBoost/XGBoost modules with MLflow integration
  - Shared utilities for feature selection and data validation
- **Improvements:**
  - Consolidate common functions into shared modules
  - Implement async processing for long-running tasks
  - Use in-memory state/database for training context

## 3. Architectural Design

### A. Component Separation
1. **Data Ingestion & Validation:**
   - Centralized dataset loading/validation with MLflow-compatible conversions
2. **Model Training Modules:**
   - Separate XGBoost/CatBoost implementations with unified API interface
3. **Logging & MLflow:**
   - Standardized ExperimentLogger usage across components
   - Artifact validation and metadata capture
4. **MCPS API Layer:**
   - FastAPI/Flask implementation with endpoints for:
     - Training operations
     - Real-time monitoring
     - Context management
   - Async task processing for non-blocking operations

### B. Communication Framework
- **Shared State:** In-memory store for training context and metrics
- **Real-Time Updates:** Websocket/polling mechanisms for status changes
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging with error contextualization
