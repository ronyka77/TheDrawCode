# Soccer Match Draw Prediction Using Advanced Ensemble Models

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to achieve high accuracy in predicting draw outcomes in soccer matches. This is accomplished by leveraging a sophisticated ensemble modeling approach designed to capture the nuanced patterns associated with draw outcomes. The project aims to push the boundaries of draw prediction accuracy, providing valuable insights for teams, analysts, and betting markets.

## Overview

This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising 20,000 matches from the last four years across 20 soccer leagues. Each match is represented by 117 statistical attributes. The core of the project involves developing a robust predictive model to identify matches likely to end in a draw, employing advanced machine learning techniques and ensemble methods.

## Data Exploration and Feature Engineering

The project begins with a thorough data exploration phase to identify key features and relationships within the dataset. Feature engineering plays a crucial role, creating new features such as rolling averages of team performance metrics to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models. Advanced features, including those derived from the Poisson distribution, are also incorporated to better model goal-scoring dynamics.

## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

Data is sourced from the API-Football API and stored in MongoDB. The `get_fixtures.py` script handles data acquisition, including:

*   Retrieving league information and seasons.
*   Fetching fixtures for specific leagues and seasons.
*   Collecting detailed match statistics.

The data is then preprocessed and stored in both JSON files and MongoDB for efficient access and management.

## Modeling Strategy

The modeling strategy integrates several advanced techniques:

*   **Base Models**: Utilizes XGBoost, CatBoost, and TabNet (with TabTransformer) to handle tabular data and capture complex interactions between features.
*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Integrates GNNs to understand team relationships and historical performance by constructing graphs with teams as nodes and matches as edges.
*   **Sequence Models**: Employs LSTMs or Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to capture the temporal dynamics of recent match performance.
*   **Ensemble Learning**: Combines predictions from base models, GNN embeddings, and sequence embeddings using a meta-learner, such as logistic regression or a small neural network, to achieve a robust final prediction.
*   **Imbalance Mitigation**: Addresses class imbalance using techniques such as focal loss, class weighting, and oversampling to ensure the model performs well on the minority class (draws).
*   **Calibration and Post-Processing**: Applies calibration techniques post-training to ensure reliable decision-making and accurate probability estimates.

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using a variety of metrics, with a focus on the draw class:

*   **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the predictions.
*   **F2-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, with a higher weight on recall, suitable for imbalanced datasets.
*   **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
*   **Recall**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
*   **AUC-ROC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, measuring the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
*   **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

## Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning

The project employs rigorous cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance:

*   **Cross-Validation**: Utilizes k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to find the best hyperparameter settings for each model.

## Model Interpretability

Model interpretability is enhanced using techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). These methods help understand the contribution of individual features to the model's predictions, providing transparency and insights into the model's decision-making process.

## Deployment and Real-World Application

The final model is designed for deployment in real-world applications, including:

*   **Sports Analytics Platforms**: Providing insights into match outcomes for analysts and teams.
*   **Betting Systems**: Assisting in making informed betting decisions.
*   **Team Strategy Development**: Helping teams understand factors contributing to draw outcomes and adjust their strategies accordingly.

## Future Work and Scalability

Future work may include:

*   **Expanding to More Leagues**: Incorporating data from additional soccer leagues to enhance the model's generalizability.
*   **Incorporating Live Data**: Integrating live match data to provide real-time predictions.
*   **Exploring Additional ML Techniques**: Investigating other advanced machine learning techniques to further improve prediction accuracy.

The model's architecture is designed for scalability, allowing for easy expansion and integration of new data sources and techniques.

## Collaboration and Stakeholder Engagement

Collaboration with domain experts is crucial to validate the model's predictions and ensure practical relevance. Stakeholder feedback is incorporated throughout the development process to align the project with real-world needs and expectations.

## Ethical Considerations

The project addresses ethical considerations, emphasizing responsible gambling practices and the implications for betting markets. It is essential to use the model's predictions responsibly and ethically.

## Expected Outcomes

By integrating GNNs and sequence embeddings with advanced ensemble models, the project aims to significantly improve the accuracy of draw predictions in soccer matches. The final model will be rigorously evaluated, focusing on metrics such as accuracy and F2-score, with particular attention to improving recall for the draw class. The insights gained from this project will provide valuable information for teams, analysts, and betting markets, contributing to a deeper understanding of match outcomes.
